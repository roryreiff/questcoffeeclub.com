comment: Ultra fresh, medium roast coffee which was a huge change from the darker roasts i usually find. Coming from Melbourne, Australia where we've had an awesome small batch, light / medium roast following for 20+ years - Quest reminds me of home.. Bright, floral, fruity beans done right!
recommend?: Yes
