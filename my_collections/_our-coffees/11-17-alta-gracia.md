<h5>Put your hands together</h5>
<p>Alta Gracia, roughly translated as "High Grace", comes from the particularly high altitudes of the Nariño region in the Southwest tip of Colombia. The relatively low average temperatures (68° F) and volcanic laden soils, combined with the extreme altitudes, make for a perfect setting for our November coffee.</p>
<p>Alta Gracia represents a total of 18 different farms (most smaller than a hectare) that form the Alto San Diego Association. The farms grow a mixture of Castillo, Caturra and Colombia varieties of coffee beans. During harvest time, the farmers all work together and pick their coffee cherries by hand, a process even more impressive given the steepness of the hills in the region.</p>
<p>During our numerous tastings of Alta Gracia, we noticed a juicy, caramel body; a bright, citrus acidity; and notes of cane sugar, dried apricots and citrus fruits.</p>
<p class="footnote">Beyond the reference to it's lofty origins, Alta Gracia also gets it's namesake from the Alta Gracia cafe and bar located in the Poblado neighborhood of Medellin, Colombia. It's a favorite spot of ours for an expertly mixed cocktail and live mixed music. If you get the chance to visit, make sure to order a lychee martini or a Manhattan (not on the menu). Shown on the front of this card is the Las Lajas Sanctuary, a basilica church situated in the Nariño region of Colombia.</p>
