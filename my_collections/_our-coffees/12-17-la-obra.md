<h5>It takes a village</h5>
<p>La Obra, translated as "the play" but more generally referring to something that is the culmination of hard work and care, comes from the high altitudes of the Cauca region in the Southwest of Colombia.</p>
<p>La Obra represents the hard work and community spirit of a group of 167 coffee producers, most with additional land devoted to crops such as bananas and oranges. The demand of maintaining these lands in accordance with the standards required for organic certification mean that most of these producers work on their own farms and use their spare time to help out other members.</p> 
<p>This coffee is truly a labor of love and devotion to community. In addition to the high altitude and quality bean varieties (including Colombia, Caturra, Castillo and Typica), it's process includes a meticulous 12 hour fermentation period, four washes, and parabolic drying.</p>
<p>During our cupping sessions with La Obra, we found it offered a balance of toffee and caramel sweetness, tangy lime and lemongrass, as well as more delicate touches of melon and florals. We're excited to be able to bring this masterpiece of community effort to your cups. We hope you enjoy it!</p>
